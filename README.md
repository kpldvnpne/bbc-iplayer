# bbc-iplayer

This is an implementation of [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This is useful when you want to use a VPN
with BBC iPlayer (because it only works for UK locations) but you don't want to use VPN for every other sites/application. You might want to do this because VPN is slower
and you have certain data pack/bandwidth for the VPN.

To use it, just download the setup from releases and install it. 

If you want to build it yourself, you can clone the repository and run `npm run make` after doing `npm install`.
